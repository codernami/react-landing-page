### What I learned

This project is a start for learning React. I watched the React Styled Components Tutorial from Traversy Media. It was a great experience working with this new concept.

### Continued development

This Frontend Mentor challenge was the first one I developed in React. I will continue learning more about React and how to apply new concepts to new projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tutorial from Traversy Media about React Styled Components](https://youtu.be/02zO0hZmwnw) - This tutorial helped me to learn how to create styled-components and how to apply global styles, props, and themes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Codesandbox](https://www.codesandbox.io) - This is a great online code editor. It helped me to develop this project. I liked this platform and will use it going forward.

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - This tool lets us deploy our projects and share our live sites.

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) - It helps me to write this readme in English and correct misspellings.
