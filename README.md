## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project is a start for learning react. Also I feel curiousity about styled-components and for my surprise it was amazing, so useful and practical.

### Continued development

This project was the first one to continue learning react.

### Useful resources

- [Tutorial from Traversy Media about React Styled Components](https://youtu.be/02zO0hZmwnw) - This tutorial helped me to learn how to create styled components, the use of Global styles, props and themes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Codersandbox](https://www.codesandbox.io) - This is an amazing online code editor which helped me to develop this project. I really liked this platform and will use it going forward.
